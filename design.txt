Overall Design

Uses a newspaper (frontpage) as the inspiration. Nice big 
title (old elnglish font perhaps). info bar should include 
general controls as well as indicate if a user is logged in and the 
amount of time currently spent on this puzzle (HH:MM:SS).
Puzzle - classic look with numbers in upper right hand corner just
for word starts.
Across and Down lists formatted like newspaper articles (where the
puzzle is like an embedded image on the page.)
Footer for copyright acknowledgements if any.

User Interface

Drop Down - for controlling saving, bailing, pause (possibly hint)

Puzzle - click numbered box to highlight clue 
and begin in that box with guess. click twice to change orientation.
Or click on clue to highlight boxes to begin typing.
Use the arrow keys to move around in the word without destroying
letters already placed. We will need to keep track of what clue we
are on. In all cases across comes first, then down if possible.
