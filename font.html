    <p>Fonts play a crucial role in web design and can greatly 
        affect the readability and aesthetics of a website. 
        Choosing the right font can enhance the user experience and convey the desired tone and message.</p>
    <div>Here is some text I  don't know what to do with.</div>
    <p>There are various types of fonts available, including serif, sans-serif, monospace, and cursive. Each type has its own unique characteristics and is suitable for different purposes.</p>
    <p>Web designers often use web-safe fonts to ensure that their text appears consistently across different browsers and devices. Additionally, custom fonts can be embedded using CSS to provide a unique look and feel.</p>
