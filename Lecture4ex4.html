					One of the interesting features of ADHD is the ability to hyper focus on 
					things you really enjoy or find interesting. That is how I managed to 
					pull together one lecture, one RPG campaign setting, and a collaborative 
					fiction blog all in a few days (plus I ran two other RPG nights and 
					we had a really nice social evening with friends in there too).
				</p>

				<p>
					Last week I showed up at my friend Richard's place for some gaming. We 
					have an ongoing Call of Cthulhu campaign that meets bi-weekly. This was 
					our off week actually but Richard wanted to try out a new role playing 
					game (RPG) system called the one roll engine (ORE). This is the system 
					used for the game GODLIKE which is a WWII super heroes game. That group 
					is big on historical contexts - we play Call of Cthulhu in 1920s Alymer 
					and the GM puts a lot of work into the historical details. Richard 
					wanted to try the NEMESIS version of ORE which is meant for horror 
					genre role playing - we re-ran one of our Cthulhu scenarios with the system.
				</p>

				<p>
					ORE uses 1 to 10 ten-sided dice for each player. That is all. And one roll 
					tells you a lot of detail. For example in combat one contested roll 
					(two people roll their dice) you can tell who hit, who hit first, how 
					hard they hit, and even where they hit. If they were also dodging you 
					can find out how that went too. It is pretty elegant. You basically are 
					looking for sets of numbers. It is also quite a bit faster than anything 
					I've played before. Plus it feels awesome when you have 6 or more dice 
					rolling off your hand.
				</p>

				<p>
					I wasn't convinced that it would be a good replacement for the Cthulhu 
					campaign, we've a lot invested already in our characters. But it solved 
					a problem we had with the idea of running a zombie apocalypse RPG. In a 
					zombie apocalypse characters are going to die, a lot, and they are 
					not coming back like in D&D. So when you have a system where you spend 
					oodles of time lovingly tweaking your character it sucks to not make it 
					past the first hour. NEMESIS characters, especially when you drop the 
					spells stuff, come together quick. So if you die, no big deal, you can 
					find another character holed up in a house not far away, and bang you 
					are back in the game. Actually I've made it even easier by creating a 
					book of character archetypes - each having the same about of points in 
					stats and skills and a third or less of those points are not already 
					allotted already - so you pick an archetype and spread out a few skill 
					points. Easy. Also I am having the players operate two characters at 
					all times - they can switch between them, but only have to logistically 
					operate one. If they die then they can keep playing while the story 
					leads them to another.
				</p>

				<p>
					Richard has taken to using customized FIASCO setups to establish the 
					relationships between each of the characters. FIASCO is a great one 
					night RPG that is more of an exercise in improv than anything else. 
					With the right group FIASCO is an amazing game. So we set up a zombie 
					apocalypse FIASCO scenario which we will run to relate the players 
					characters to each other. I wrote an anatomy of the disease (I like 
					the disease angle best for zombies) which details how it is transmitted 
					and how it progresses in a person. Now I have zombies. Then I fleshed 
					out a 44 page worldbook which includes: the player information 
					(archetypes, etc.); rules tweaks; the FIASCO setup; NPC templates; 
					collection of significant NPCs; rules for scavanging and travelling; 
					and a chart that details survival items in terms of scarcity and 
					value (for bartering). Right now I have place holder art all through 
					it - stuff off google search - but if I make this into something 
					publishable I'll try to get Richard to illustrate it. He has a game 
					company and lots of experience doing this stuff. We'd probably not 
					be able to charge much (if anything) because the NEMESIS rules are 
					actually free!
				</p>

				<p>
					I also decided that with such a rich storytelling opportunity, it would 
					be fun to create a survivors website and invite people to participate 
					by commenting on posts. So I set up Signs of the End which has a great
					but nasty URL! So far it follows the trials of a few people in Maine, 
					our game will start at a high school in Lewiston, ME. I did a bit 
					of scene prep, getting familiar with the area through google maps and 
					searching things like gun laws in Maine. We will make good use of 
					technology in this game. If you want to join in - why not have some 
					fun on the blog? If you want to run your own campaign why not down 
					load the NEMESIS rules and I could be convinced to let you have a 
					beta copy of the setting book.
