        <h1>Using GitHub Copilot in an Educational Setting</h1>
        <p> GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool 
            that can assist students and educators in writing code 
            more efficiently. It leverages machine learning models 
            to provide code suggestions based on the context of the 
            current file.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Benefits for Students</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Learning:</strong> Students can 
                learn new coding techniques and best practices by 
                observing the suggestions provided by Copilot.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Increased Productivity:</strong> Copilot 
                helps students write code faster by reducing the 
                amount of boilerplate code they need to write manually.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Error Reduction:</strong> By providing 
                context-aware suggestions, Copilot can help students 
                avoid common coding mistakes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Benefits for Educators</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Savings:</strong> Educators can save 
                time on grading and providing feedback by using 
                Copilot to quickly review and suggest improvements 
                to student code.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Focus on Concepts:</strong> With Copilot 
                handling some of the more tedious aspects of coding, 
                educators can focus on teaching core programming 
                concepts and problem-solving skills.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Resource for Examples:</strong> Copilot 
                can generate code examples that educators can 
                use in their lessons to illustrate specific 
                concepts or techniques.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="challenges">Challenges and Considerations</h2>
        <p>While GitHub Copilot offers many benefits, there are 
            also some challenges and considerations to keep in mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dependency:</strong> Students may 
                become overly reliant on Copilot and not develop 
                their own coding skills.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The suggestions provided 
                by Copilot are not always accurate or optimal, 
                so students and educators need to critically 
                evaluate the generated code.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Use:</strong> It is important to 
                ensure that students use Copilot ethically and 
                do not pass off generated code as their own 
                work without proper attribution.
            </li>
        </ul>
